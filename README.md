# Nationality Predictor App  

This is a simple nationality predictor app that I built as part of my fullstack web dev bootcamp with CoGrammar. The application calls an API using user input of a name and then returns a predicted nationality based on the name and percentage liklehood. This project allowed me to practice async API calls and React hooks such as useRef, useState, and useEffect. 


## Features
